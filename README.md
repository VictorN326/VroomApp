Background and motivation
As a group, we wanted to build an application to give users an additional option when it comes to rates for ridesharing options. We looked into the competitors in detail and realized that all applications have similar rates. Still, even a few pennies make a difference in application usage. We also decided to develop this app to help the environment so we could help reduce carbon emissions. In addition to helping the environment, we want to help society and the economy. This app can allow users to earn an income by driving for the app. It can also help reduce the number of impaired drivers off the roads and make it safer. 
Summary
Vroom is a ridesharing application that allows users to request a pickup and ride to their desired location, with the help of nearby drivers. Vroom also tracks the current ride in real-time, being able to take into account accidents and roadwork, then find the quickets  possible route to the desired location. Lastly, vroom also is able to suggest popular locations to visit such as, malls restaurants, entertainment etc.
